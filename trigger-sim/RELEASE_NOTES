Apr. 12, 2023 don la dieu (nega AT icecube.umd.edu)
---------------------------------------------------
IceTray Release v1.6.0

* Restore use of BUILD_${PROJECT}=OFF (#3058)

Dec. 12, 2022 don la dieu (nega AT icecube.umd.edu)
---------------------------------------------------
IceTray Release v1.5.0

* Cleaned comments on SimpleMajorityTriggerAlgorithm.h
* log_error -> log_fatal if DomSet is queried but not found.
* Use sphinx extension extlinks to shorten/correct links

Jul. 29, 2022 don la dieu (nega AT icecube.umd.edu)
---------------------------------------------------
IceTray Release v1.4.0

* Added missing DomSets to the InDOMSet utility function, so that IceTop triggers post-2016 and other new triggers can be simulated:
    - DomSet 3 (IceTop) and 8 (IceTop volume-trigger participants)  
    - DomSets 7 (Scintillators), 9 (IceAct), and 10 (DMIce)
    - DomSet 11 (full InIce), introduced for IC86.2022 to avoid conflicts with DMIce
      (previously, this DomSet was left blank for SMT8 and SLOP)
* Changed CylinderTrigger launchname default to "", so that the default behavior will be to choose either
  IceTop or InIce raw data according to the SourceID.
* Drop support for Python 2
* Clean up python bindings / modules
* Fix trigger-sim rejecting large but valid run and event ID values (#2828)

Feb. 21, 2022 don la dieu (nega AT icecube.umd.edu)
---------------------------------------------------
IceTray release v1.3.0

* Added scripts and docs to help with retriggering
* Addressed compilation warnings
* Documentation cleanup
* (r182735) Removed CoincidenceAfterProcessing module.

October 6th, 2020 Alex Olivas (aolivas@umd.edu)
-----------------------------------------------
Combo Release V01-01-00

* (r179360) Added Upgrade/Gen2 functionality to CylinderTrigger. This allows us to
  pass in any combination of I3DOMLaunches (from IC86) and I3RecoPulses
  (from Upgrade or Gen2) to form a trigger. Only launches and pulses with
  the LC flag set are included in triggers.
  Note the new option, MeasurementMode, that controls which LC pulses are
  usable for triggering.

    - 0: Use all LC pulses, including multiple pulses on a single PMT
    - 1: Use first LC pulse from each PMT
    - 2: Use first LC pulse from each module

Dec. 20, 2019 Alex Olivas (aolivas@umd.edu)
-------------------------------------------
Combo Release V00-00-00

* (r163657) Bug fix: The end of the readout window is calculated w.r.t.
  the end of the trigger and not the start of the trigger.  Note this is
  only a bug when the subdetector is different from the trigger source, so
  only affects InIce/IceTop coincident events.

June 20, 2018 Juan Carlos Diaz-Velez (juancarlos@icecube.wisc.edu)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V08-01-01

* Minor clean up of import statements

Nov 2, 2017 Juan Carlos Diaz-Velez (juancarlos@icecube.wisc.edu)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Release V08-01-00

* (cweaver) actually use the SkipKeys list everywhere it's needed. Fixes failures..

March 22, 2016 Alex Olivas (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
---------------------------------------------------
Release V08-00-00

* (r154010) Bug fix for I3EventHeader end time calculation.
* (r147334) CylinderTrigger support IceTop.
* (r146654) Uses the new serialization project.
* (r146589) Dropped ULEE support.  Now only support IC59 and later.

May 16, 2016 Alex Olivas (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
-------------------------------------------------
Release V07-07-03

* Bugfix : For multiple trigger hierarchies only one (whichever was last pulled from the frame) was being used.  Now all are used and the earliest trigger time becomes the reference.
* I3TimeShifter effectively skips objects that can't be deserialized.  This is done by catching the throw so let us know if you see the performance hit.
* Added the RunID option to I3GlobalTriggerSim and the TriggerSim segment.  It is critical for many downstream analyses that the (RunID, EventID) make a unique pair. (r144178)
* Added the option to randomize I3Times over a specified interval.
* **NB** : I3TimeShifter no longer shifts I3Double objects by default.  There's no way in principle to determine whether or not they're time-like.  In general they won't be, so let's assume they're not.  The user has to explicitly state which I3Doubles to shift.
* Added 'print_trigger_configuration.py' script that will dump the trigger configuration for a given GCD file.
* I3MCPMTResponseMaps are no longer shifted.  We don't use them in current simulations and there likely aren't any old sets that contain them that we'd want to retrigger.  They were too large and typically not saved. (r138946)
* Reactivated old SMT tests. (r137488)
* Removed the C++ version of I3TimeShifter.  It's not what's being used in recent production, so it's better for continuity to stick with the python version.

* Remove I3InIceTriggerDefaults and I3IceTopTriggerDefaults. They weren't being used.

July 10, 2014 Alex Olivas (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
--------------------------------------------------
Release V07-06-04

* Cleaned up cmake for pybindings.

January 13, 2014 Meike de With (meike.de.with@desy.de)

Release V07-06-03

* Clean up deprecation warnings

  -- Meike de With

* Make project compatible with Python 3

  -- Nathan Whitehorn

* Improve error message (when module can't be configured) for
  SimpleMajorityTrigger

  -- Alex Olivas


December 20th Alex Olivas (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
--------------------------------------------------
Release V07-05-00

* Added pure python I3TimeShifter which recursively walks frame objects
  looking for time-like objects to shift.  These are object with the attributes
  "time","start_time","end_time","flash_time",and "value" (for I3Doubles).
  This also ignores I3Time for backwards compatibility, but is probably worth
  revisiting.

June 27, 2012 Emanuel Jacobi  (emanuel.jacobi@desy.de)

  fallback to the 2011 version

Going to get serious about release notes for individual projects.
